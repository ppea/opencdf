This project provides a Charging Data Function (CDF) which is a sink/correlation function for IMS Diameter offline charging events.

3GPP IMS defines the Rf reference point that transports offline charging events from the Charging Trigger Function (CTF) aka the CSCFs to the Charging Data Function for correlation and production of a summary CDR.

3GPP TS 32.299 defines the format of the Rf reference point.

This project is still in the design phase. Sorry to get your hopes up. :-) It will be written in Erlang and is a companion to  the open-cgf project.
